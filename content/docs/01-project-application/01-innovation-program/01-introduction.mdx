# Introduction to the University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program

The University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program (or "Innovation Program" for short) is a nationwide initiative designed to cultivate students' innovative thinking and entrepreneurial capabilities. It offers you a chance to work on real projects while still in school, giving you an early taste of research or entrepreneurship and building a foundation for your future development. ✨

## Program Background

As a key component of higher education reform, this program encourages undergraduates to engage in innovative research and entrepreneurial activities under faculty guidance. It's more than just a policy—it's a valuable opportunity to gain practical experience while still in an academic environment.

> "To further strengthen the training of university students' innovation and entrepreneurship capabilities, enhance students' innovation awareness and entrepreneurial abilities, and cultivate high-level talents that meet the needs of educational reform and national development..." [^1]

Behind this official statement lies the nation's emphasis on developing innovative talent—in today's competitive era, cultivating innovation through practical experience has become an essential direction in higher education. 🚀

## Project Categories

The Innovation Program offers three types of projects, each with its own characteristics and value:

> **Note:** In practice, most students choose Innovation Training Projects(In fact, sometimes it depends on which instructor chooses), and the reference samples in this guide are primarily based on Innovation Training Projects. While other types are valuable, they are relatively more complex and demanding.

### 1. Innovation Training Projects

These research-oriented projects will have you:
- Proposing an innovative research topic
- Preparing thoroughly for your research
- Implementing your project plan
- Writing a research report
- Publicly presenting your findings

Research is a journey into the unknown 📚, and these projects let you experience the complete process from raising questions to finding answers, developing your research mindset and problem-solving abilities.

### 2. Entrepreneurship Training Projects

Ideal for students with business acumen, your team will complete:
- Business plan development
- Feasibility studies
- Business operation simulations
- Entrepreneurial practice
- Entrepreneurship report writing

Entrepreneurship is like an exploration without standard answers 🧭. These projects provide a low-risk environment to transform creative ideas into concrete plans and validate concepts through practical application.

### 3. Entrepreneurship Practice Projects

This is actual entrepreneurship, guided by both university and industry mentors:
- Further developing previous project outcomes
- Creating products or services with market potential
- Actually registering a company

Real entrepreneurship requires courage and persistence 💪. These projects allow you to experience the challenges and opportunities of the entrepreneurial journey in advance, accumulating valuable practical experience.

## Project Levels and Evaluation

Each year, projects are categorized into different levels based on quality, innovation, and potential:

> **Important:** Project levels are not self-selected by students but are determined by the college based on project quality. When applying, focus on submitting a high-quality project proposal—the level will be decided by the review panel.

1. **Submit your application**: Enter your ideas through the system
2. **Faculty endorsement**: Secure support from a faculty advisor
3. **College review**: Expert panels evaluate your project's value
4. **Project classification**: Final division into three levels (data as of April 2025):
   - **University-level projects**: Around 360 slots (entry level, suitable for first attempts)
   - **Provincial-level projects**: Around 90 slots (intermediate recognition, requiring higher quality)
   - **National-level projects**: Around 30 slots (highest recognition, only truly outstanding projects qualify)

> **Detailed data:** For more information about historical project quota allocations, please refer to [Project Quantity and Level Allocation Details](/docs/01-project-application/01-innovation-program/07-project-allocation).

As the saying goes: "A thousand-mile journey begins with a single step" 🏗️. Don't feel pressured to aim for the highest level immediately—completing a quality university-level project is already a significant achievement. Focus on doing the project well, and recognition will follow naturally.

## Project Timeline

After approval, projects progress along this timeline:
1. **Initiation phase** (after approval): Develop detailed plans and clarify responsibilities
2. **Implementation phase** (first year): Execute project activities according to plan
3. **Mid-term evaluation** (end of first year): Assess project progress and quality
4. **Completion phase** (second year): Compile results and prepare for conclusion
5. **Conclusion phase** (end of second year): Different requirements based on level:
   - **University-level projects**: Simply submit a conclusion report
   - **Provincial and National-level projects**: Participate in a defense presentation

## The Importance of Project Completion

Project completion is more than just a formality—it's the culmination of your entire project:
- **Final funding portion**: The remaining 20% of funds are only released after successful completion
- **Academic credit and recognition**: Many colleges make successful completion a prerequisite for credit and honors
- **Foundation for future development**: Completed projects become important assets for graduate school applications and job searches

"The last mile is half the journey" 🏁. Those who persevere to the end truly complete the challenge. The difficulty of completion increases with project level, so while pursuing higher honors, be rational about assessing your capabilities.

## Advice on Project Levels

When conceptualizing your project, consider these suggestions based on your circumstances:

> **Remember:** While these suggestions can guide your preparation, the final project level is determined by the review committee. Focus on creating the best possible project rather than aiming for a specific level.

- **First-time participants**: University-level projects are better for gaining experience, with easier completion requirements 👶
- **Those with some foundation**: You might try for provincial-level projects, but be prepared for additional work 🧑‍🎓
- **Strong performers**: If your project truly has outstanding innovation points, you might aim for national level, but ensure your team has sufficient capacity to complete it 🔥

Start small and progress gradually—the Innovation Program may become one of the most valuable experiences in your college career. Choose challenges that suit you to gain growth while avoiding excessive pressure.
