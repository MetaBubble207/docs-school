## üìë Invoice Guide

> This section corresponds to steps 1Ô∏è‚É£ and 2Ô∏è‚É£ in the overview: purchasing items and obtaining valid invoices

Invoicing generally falls into two categories: **obtaining invoices before purchase** and **obtaining invoices after purchase**.

### Obtaining Invoices Before Purchase

> Using JD.com as an example, follow these steps:

1. Find the **Invoice Information** option at the bottom of the payment page
   <img src="/images/quick-reimbursement/ÊîØ‰ªòÈ°µÈù¢.png" alt="Invoice option" width="50%" />

2. Select "Electronic Invoice" and fill in the invoice information:
   - Invoice title: Select "Unit" and enter the full name of the university (**Dongguan University of Technology**)
   - Invoice content: Select "Product Category" (recommended) or "Details"
   - Click submit order after completion
   
   <img src="/images/quick-reimbursement/ÂèëÁ•®ÁºñËæëÈ°µÈù¢.png" alt="Invoice editing page" width="50%" />

> **üíº University Invoice Information:**
> 
> | Item | Content |
> | :---: | :--- |
> | Institution Name | ‰∏úËéûÁêÜÂ∑•Â≠¶Èô¢ |
> | Tax ID | 1244 1900 4572 3201 24 |
> | Address | ‰∏úËéûÂ∏ÇÊùæÂ±±ÊπñÁßëÊäÄ‰∫ß‰∏öÂõ≠Âå∫Â§ßÂ≠¶Ë∑Ø1Âè∑ |
> | Phone | 22861616 |
> | Bank | ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂ∑•ÂïÜÈì∂Ë°åÂ§ßÂ≤≠Â±±ÊîØË°å |
> | Bank Account | 2010 0273 2920 0310 794 |

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
>
> - üíº **Invoice Type Restrictions**: Shenzhen VAT invoices and Zhejiang invoices typically cannot be reimbursed through normal procedures. Ask vendors to issue standard VAT invoices whenever possible; consult your advisor if there are difficulties.
> - üîç **Invoice Content Selection**: Prioritize "Product Category" over "Product Details." During financial review, category descriptions are generally easier to get approved.
> - ‚úÖ **Invoice Verification**: After the vendor ships, you can download and print the electronic invoice from the order details. Ensure the university name is clearly displayed on the invoice.

### Obtaining Invoices After Purchase

If you've already made a purchase without proper invoicing, you can request supplementary invoices:

1. Find the after-sales service or invoice option on your order details page
   <img src="/images/quick-reimbursement/ËÆ¢ÂçïËØ¶ÊÉÖ.png" alt="Order details" width="50%" />

2. Select "Apply for Invoice" or "Change Invoice", and follow the prompts
   <img src="/images/quick-reimbursement/Áî≥ËØ∑Êç¢ÂºÄ.png" alt="Apply for change" width="50%" />

### Retrieving Electronic Invoices

Steps for retrieving electronic invoices:

1. Open the order details page
2. Click "More" ‚Üí "View Invoice"
3. Click the "Send to Email" button in the bottom right
4. The system will send a PDF version of the invoice to your specified email
