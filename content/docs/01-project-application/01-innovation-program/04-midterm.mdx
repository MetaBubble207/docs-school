# 🚀 Mid-term Assessment Process

The mid-term assessment is a critical milestone for Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program projects. It typically occurs midway through the project timeline (usually at the end of the first year) and serves as a checkpoint to evaluate progress, identify challenges, and make necessary adjustments.

## 📅 Timeline

> 📢 **Important Note**: The specific dates may vary each year. Please refer to the latest notice on the Academic Affairs Office website: [Academic Affairs Office Practice Notice](https://jwb.dgut.edu.cn/tzgg/sjtz.htm)

Reference timeline based on recent years:
- 📝 **System Opening**: Early December (e.g., December 5, 2023)
- ⏰ **Student Submission Deadline**: Late February of the following year (e.g., February 21, 2024)
- 📋 **Faculty Advisor Review Deadline**: Late February of the following year (e.g., February 25, 2024)
- 🎉 **Department Review Deadline**: Early March of the following year (e.g., March 10, 2024)

## 💰 Importance of Mid-term Assessment

The mid-term assessment serves several important purposes:

1. **Progress Evaluation**: To assess whether the project is proceeding according to the original plan
2. **Quality Control**: To ensure the quality of the research or entrepreneurial activities
3. **Problem Identification**: To identify and address any challenges or obstacles
4. **Funding Release**: To determine eligibility for the release of the second phase of funding (50% of the total)
5. **Project Adjustment**: To provide an opportunity to adjust project goals or methodologies if necessary

> ⚠️ **Special Reminder**: Only projects that pass the mid-term assessment will receive the second phase of research funding!
