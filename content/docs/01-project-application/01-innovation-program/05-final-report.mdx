# 🎯 Final Assessment Process

The final assessment is the last major stage of your Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program project. It marks the official completion of your project and involves a comprehensive summary and evaluation of your project outcomes, achievements, and findings.

## 📅 Timeline

> 📢 **Important Note**: The specific dates may vary each year. Please refer to the latest notice on the Academic Affairs Office website: [Academic Affairs Office Practice Notice](https://jwb.dgut.edu.cn/tzgg/sjtz.htm)

Reference timeline based on recent years:
- 📝 **System Opening**: Early December (e.g., December 2, 2024)
- ⏰ **Student Submission Deadline**: Mid-February of the following year (e.g., February 16, 2025)

## 💼 Importance of Final Assessment

The final assessment serves several key functions:

1. **Completion Verification**: Confirms that the project has been completed according to plan and achieved its expected goals
2. **Outcome Evaluation**: Evaluates the quality, innovation, and impact of project outcomes
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Provides reference and inspiration for future research and related projects
4. **Fund Usage Audit**: Verifies the appropriate use of project funds
5. **Capability Assessment**: Evaluates students' growth and capability development during the project

> ⚠️ **Special Reminder**: You must pass the final assessment to complete the reimbursement of your remaining funds! Project leaders need to finalize expense reimbursement within the specified timeframe (e.g., by May 2025).

### Step 3: Upload Research Outcomes

In addition to completing the final report, you need to upload project outcomes and supporting materials:

1. 📄 **Complete Final Report** (PDF format)
   - The system will automatically generate a report, download it after confirmation
   - It's recommended to keep your own backup

2. 📑 **Research Outcome Documentation**
   > ⚠️ **Important Note**: The system only allows uploading **one** attachment file. If you have multiple materials, combine them into a single ZIP archive

   Your ZIP archive may include:
   - Full text of papers or acceptance notices
   - Patent application receipts or authorization certificates
   - Award certificate scans
   - Photos or videos of physical outcomes (control file sizes)
   - Software copyright certificates

3. 💻 **Software/Code Submission Guidelines**
   - If your project outcome is software, you may submit only the core code files
   - Code should include necessary comments to help evaluation experts understand
   - You may include a brief installation/usage documentation
   - If the code is extensive, consider submitting only key components with a README explanation
   - Ensure the compressed file size meets system limitations (typically under 20MB)

4. 📊 **File Organization Recommendations**
   - Use clear naming for files in your archive
   - Create different folders by category (e.g., "Papers", "Patents", "Award Certificates", etc.)
   - Add an index document listing all files with brief descriptions
   - Ensure important files are placed in obvious locations

> 💡 **Tip**: Before submission, ensure the compressed package can be opened normally and all files are intact. It's best to have someone else test downloading and opening it to ensure evaluation experts can easily review your materials.
